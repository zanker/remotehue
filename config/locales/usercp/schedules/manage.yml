          vs_remotehue: Hue Lights Controller vs Remote Hue
          desc_1: Remote Hue's scheduler function slightly differently from Hue Lights Controller. If you didn't use HLC, you can close this window.
          desc_2: If you want to turn your lights on at 7:00 AM and then off at 7:20 AM, you would need to create two separate schedules.
          desc_3: Schedules are no longer offset by transition time. If you use a 5 minute transition time and want it done by 8:00 AM, your schedule should run at 7:55 AM.
          desc_4: Rather than setting a static light color or set to be applied when the schedule runs, you now associate triggers that are ran when the schedule runs.
          desc_5: These changes were made to minimize potential bugs and make it easier for people to manage schedules.
